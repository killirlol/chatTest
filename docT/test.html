In the fall of 1970, two prototypes of the vehicle were created, which differed in additional weapons: four ATGMs were installed on the sides of the tower, on the gunner's hatch was a twin installation of DShK machine guns. Tests that took place in 1971-1973 showed the unreliability of the design, after which work on the project was stopped in 1974.</p>
